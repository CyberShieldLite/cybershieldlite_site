    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h3>🔍 What is CyberShield Lite?</h3>
    <p>CyberShield Lite is a remote cybersecurity scanning tool that detects vulnerabilities in your public-facing servers and web applications using Nmap and OpenVAS. We generate professional reports with CVEs, CVSS scores, and mitigation tips.</p>

    <h3>🛡️ Is this a penetration test?</h3>
    <p>No. CyberShield Lite is a passive vulnerability scanner — it does not exploit vulnerabilities. It is designed to assess risk ethically and safely with prior client authorization.</p>

    <h3>📄 Do I need to sign any documents?</h3>
    <p>Yes. We provide an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) and a Scan Authorization Consent form before any scan is performed. This protects both parties legally.</p>

    <h3>🌐 Do you scan websites or IPs?</h3>
    <p>We can scan both. You may provide a domain (e.g. example.com) or an IP address, depending on what you’d like to assess.</p>

    <h3>📬 How long does it take to receive a report?</h3>
    <p>Once consent is signed, your scan and full PDF report are delivered within 24 hours — typically sooner.</p>

    <h3>🔐 Is my data safe?</h3>
    <p>Yes. We operate under strict data protection practices aligned with the Kenya Data Protection Act and GDPR. All communication is encrypted over HTTPS, and we never share or sell your data.</p>

    <h3>💸 How much does it cost?</h3>
    <p>We offer a Basic Plan at KES 2,500/month and a Pro Plan at KES 7,500/month. See our <a href="pricing.html">Pricing</a> page for full details.</p>

    <h3>🧪 Do you scan internal/private networks?</h3>
    <p>No. CyberShield Lite is designed for external perimeter testing only. Internal network scans require onsite appliances or full pentesting services.</p>

    <h3>🧾 What do I receive after the scan?</h3>
    <p>You’ll receive a branded PDF report containing: open ports, detected services, CVE IDs, CVSS severity scores, risk breakdowns, and suggested patches or mitigations.</p>

    <h3>🤝 Can I partner or resell your service?</h3>
    <p>Yes — reach out via the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page to inquire about partnership or white-label opportunities.</p>
